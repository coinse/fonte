Ok, so in mail type HTML the following is common

<img src="cid:SDOMSDOFMOSDOMFOSD">

The item after CID: can be almost anything (US-ASCII I think) and of any length. It corresponds to an image linked elsewhere in MIME say like this

--mimebounday
Content-ID:<SDOMSDOFMOSDOMFOSD>
Content-Type: image/jpeg.....
(snip)

So, to mark a long story somewhat shorter, I use Jsoup's sanitizer extensively. However, I need these CID references to be preserved post sanitization. addProtocols does not work because the items are not valid URLs. As a result
the above becomes <img />. Which for my purposes is not good :)
