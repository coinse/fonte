org.apache.commons.cli.Parser.processArgs() calls Util.stripLeadingAndTrailingQuotes() for all argument values. IMHO this is incorrect and totally broken.

It is trivial to create a simple test for this. Output:

    $ java -cp target/clitest.jar Clitest --balloo "this is a \"test\""
    Value of argument balloo is 'this is a "test'.

The argument 'balloo' should indeed keep its trailing double quote. It is what the shell gives it, so don't try to do something clever to it.

The offending code was committed here:
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=129874
and has been there for more than 6 years (!). Why was this committed in the first place?

The fix is trivial, just get rid of Util.stripLeadingAndTrailingQuotes(), and consequently avoid calling it from Parser.processArgs().
