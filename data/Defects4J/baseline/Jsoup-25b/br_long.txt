This tag may have been mistakenly left out of the array of preserveWhitespace tags in the Tag class:

private static final String[] preserveWhitespaceTags = {"pre", "plaintext", "title"};

There is a comment next to the preserveWhitespace  boolean that indicates this should have been added here.
 private boolean preserveWhitespace = false; // for pre, textarea, script etc
