For some reason, the caret doesn't always show up in the output when there are errors.

When test.js looks like this:


&gt;alert(1;


, the output is this:


&gt;java -jar compiler.jar --js test.js
test.js:1: ERROR - Parse error. missing ) after argument list

1 error(s), 0 warning(s)


However, when test.js looks like this (notice the line break after the semicolon):


&gt;alert(1;
&gt;


, the output is this:


&gt;java -jar compiler.jar --js test.js
test.js:1: ERROR - Parse error. missing ) after argument list
alert(1;
        ^

1 error(s), 0 warning(s)


That's the simplest reproduction of the problem that I could come up with, but I just encountered the problem in a file with ~100 LOC in it. This is the first time I believe I've run into the problem, but when it happens, my error parser fails and it becomes a pain to track down the raw output to find the actual problem.

Tested against r1171, committed 6/10 08:06. The problem is present going back to at least r1000, so this isn't a new issue.
