When updating from v 2.4.4 to 2.5.\* it appears as though annotation bundles created with `@JacksonAnnotationsInside` are ignored when placed on a mixin.  Moving the annotation bundel to the actual class seems to resolve the issue.  Below is a simple test that attempts to rename a property.  I have more complicated test cases that are also failing but this should provide some context.

``` java
public class Fun {

    @Test
    public void test() throws JsonProcessingException {
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper().addMixIn(Foo.class, FooMixin.class);
        String result = mapper.writeValueAsString(new Foo("result"));
        Assert.assertEquals("{\"bar\":\"result\"}", result);
    }

    @Target(value={ ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.METHOD })
    @Retention(value=RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
    @JacksonAnnotationsInside
    @JsonProperty("bar")
    public @interface ExposeStuff {

    }

    public abstract class FooMixin {
        @ExposeStuff
        public abstract String getStuff();
    }

    public class Foo {

        private String stuff;

        Foo(String stuff) {
            this.stuff = stuff;
        }

        public String getStuff() {
            return stuff;
        }
    }
}
```

I'm expecting the "stuff" property to be serialized as "bar".

I apologize I haven't been able to identify the culprit (and perhaps it's in my usage).  Let me know your thoughts. I'm always happy to provide more details!
