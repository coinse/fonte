The documentation for elementSiblingIndex states "Get the list index of this element in its element sibling list. I.e. if this is the first element sibling, returns 0".

This would imply that if

```
n=myElem.elementSiblingIndex();
```

then

```
myElem.parent().children().get(n)==myElem.  
```

However, this is not how elementSiblingIndex behaves. What is guaranteed is that

```
myElem.parent().children().get(n).equals(myElem).  
```

For example, if both row 2 and row 5 of a table are

```
<tr><td>Cell1</td><td>Cell2</td></tr>
```

then the Element object associated with both rows will have the same `elementSiblingIndex()`.
