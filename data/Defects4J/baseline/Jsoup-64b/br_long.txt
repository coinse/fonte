Given the input:

```html
<html>
<head>
	<style />   <!-- < - - this is the culprit -->
</head>
<body>
	<p>Whatever</p>
</body>
</html>
```

JSoup 1.8.2 and also http://try.jsoup.org/~lJwWpjXYUSTBeBZhdEnS3Mt56g4 will produce:
```html
    <html>
     <head> 
      <style></style>
     </head>
     <body>
       &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;
     </body>
    </html>
```

With `<title/>` instead of `<style/>`, the result is different but still wrong (http://try.jsoup.org/~BZ3uoMki-r904fZxUOWJgLJO7r8 ):
```html
<html>
 <head> 
  <title></title>
 </head>
 <body>
   &lt;/head&gt;  
  <p>Whatever</p>  
 </body>
</html>
```

That weirdness was fixed for `<script>` with Issue #305: http://try.jsoup.org/~3Ms6TQCrrdaA_uPgxgURYYvwFAg
```html
<html>
 <head> 
  <script></script> 
 </head> 
 <body> 
  <p>Whatever</p>  
 </body>
</html>
```

Looking [at the source](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jsoup/parser/HtmlTreeBuilderState.java#L106), it seems only the HtmlTreeBuilderState handling for `<noframes>`, `<style>` and `<title>` in the methods `handleRawText` and `handleRcData` doesn't get along with the self-closing tags.
Any other tagname I've checked (and I tried to cover all branches of that `case StartTag` switch) results in a good parse similar to the `<script>` case, which is what I'd expect.

Thanks for looking into this!
