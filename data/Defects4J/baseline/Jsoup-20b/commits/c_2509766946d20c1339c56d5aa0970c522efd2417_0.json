This addresses the issue with using jsoup and scala 2.8 discussed here: http://groups.google.com/group/jsoup/browse_thread/thread/3f7ec2fa41dfb87f  This change should be safe to commit and won't make a backwards incompatible to the public interface of jsoup (you can always reference a static member via a non-static path) for any existing users.  A recompilation of their code won't even be necessary.  All tests continue to pass for me after this change.", "commit": "\n--- a/src/main/java/org/jsoup/nodes/Document.java\n+++ b/src/main/java/org/jsoup/nodes/Document.java\n     /**\n      * A Document's output settings control the form of the text() and html() methods.\n      */\n-    public class OutputSettings implements Cloneable {\n+    public static class OutputSettings implements Cloneable {\n         private Entities.EscapeMode escapeMode = Entities.EscapeMode.base;\n         private Charset charset = Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\");\n         private CharsetEncoder charsetEncoder = charset.newEncoder();", "timestamp": 1309605125, "metainfo": ""}
