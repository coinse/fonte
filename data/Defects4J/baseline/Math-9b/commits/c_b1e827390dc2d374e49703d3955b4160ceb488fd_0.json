This problem has been discussed previously here:   http://markmail.org/message/pmbiyiqssjesq7tm  The solution implemented with this modification is to configure checkstyle in such a way the errors can be filtered out using dedicated comments in the source code:    // CHECKSTYLE: stop JavadocMethodCheck    // a bunch of functions known to trigger warnings   // that we explicitly REFUSE to fix    // CHECKSTYLE: resume JavadocMethodCheck  The checks are still performed normally in file parts not bracketed by these comments. Hence the first few methods in o.a.c.m.stat.inference.TestUtils are still checked for correct javadoc, and only for the last ones in the same files are the checks relaxed.
