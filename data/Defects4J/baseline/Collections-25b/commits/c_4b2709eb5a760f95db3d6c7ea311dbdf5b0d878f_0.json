If the user\n  * prefers to see the differences between the two sequences as global\n  * <code>replacement</code> operations acting on complete subsequences of\n  * the original sequences, he will provide an object implementing the\n- * simple {@link #ReplacementsHandler} interface, using an instance of the\n- * {@link #ReplacementsFinder} class as a command converting layer between his\n- * object and the edit script. The number of objects which are common to\n- * both initial arrays and hence are skipped between each call to the user\n- * {@link ReplacementsHandler#handleReplacement handleReplacement} method is\n- * also provided.
