When using CSVFormat.EXCEL to print a CSV file, the behavior of quote char using is not similar as Microsoft Excel does when the first string contains Chinese, Japanese or Korean (CJK) char(s).

e.g.
There are 3 data members in a record, with Japanese chars: "あ", "い", "う":
  Microsoft Excel outputs:
  あ,い,う
  Apache Common CSV outputs:
  "あ",い,う
