The current escape parsing converts <esc><char> to plain <char> if the <char> is not one of the special characters to be escaped.

This can affect unicode escapes if the <esc> character is backslash.

One way round this is to specifically check for <char> == 'u', but it seems wrong to only do this for 'u'.

Another solution would be to leave <esc><char> as is unless the <char> is one of the special characters.

There are several possible ways to treat unrecognised escapes:
- treat it as if the escape char had not been present (current behaviour)
- leave the escape char as is
- throw an exception
