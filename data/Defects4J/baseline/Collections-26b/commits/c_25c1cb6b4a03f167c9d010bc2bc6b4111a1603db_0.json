When \n+  * mappings are accessed, the mapping is moved one position away from the end\n+  * of the list, rather than all the way to the front of the list.  This means\n+  * that the \"most\" recently used, is not at the front of the list, and the \n+  * \"least\" recently used is not necessarily at the end of the list.  Here's a\n+  * simple example (Provided by Aaron Smuts on commons-dev@):\n+  *\n+  * <pre>\n+  *    Say that items 0 - 9 are put in.  The limit is 10.\n+  *\n+  *    The list looks like:\n+  *\n+  *    Index order (0-9)\n+  *    9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0\n+  *\n+  *    Item 1 is accessed and the list now looks like:\n+  *    Index order (0-9)\n+  *    9,8,7,6,5,4,3,1,2,0\n+  *\n+  *    Item 0 is accessed and the list now looks like:\n+  *    Index order (0-9)\n+  *    9,8,7,6,5,4,3,1,0,2\n+  *\n+  *    Item 2 is accessed and the list now looks like:\n+  *    Index order (0-9)\n+  *    9,8,7,6,5,4,3,1,2,0\n+  *\n+  *    Item 10 is added and the list now looks like\n+  *    Index order (0-9)\n+  *    10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,1,2\n+  *\n+  *    Item 0 was droped but it was not the least recently used element.\n+  * </pre>\n+   * </p>\n+  * <p>\n+  * Additionally, the results from entrySet() and values() are not properly \n+  * backed by the map in violation of the Map API contract.
