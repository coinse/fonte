For some use cases (one known case being use from ORM like Hibernate) it makes sense to allow use of `null` (or missing) Object Id, in cases where actual Id will be generated by something other than Jackson. It may also make sense to add matching `DeserializationFeature` which allows such a condition to either be acceptable (default), or not (throw an exception), to allow for strict checks in cases where null/missing Object Id is not a legal use case.
