It seems to me that as currently written in joda-time-2.1.jar
org.joda.time.field.FieldUtils.safeMultiply(long val1, int scalar)
doesn't detect the overflow if the long val1 == Long.MIN_VALUE and the int scalar == -1.

The attached file demonstrates what I think is the bug and suggests a patch.

I looked at the Joda Time bugs list in SourceForge but couldn't see anything that looked relevant: my apologies if I've missed something, or if I'm making a mistake with this bug report.
