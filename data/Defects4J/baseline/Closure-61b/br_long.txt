<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Try the following code, in Simple mode
Math.blah = function(test) { test.a = 5; };
var test = new Object();
Math.blah(test); 
2. The output is
Math.blah=function(a){a.a=5};var test={};


<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Note that Math.blah(test) was removed. It should not be. It issues a warning: JSC_USELESS_CODE: Suspicious code. This code lacks side-effects. Is there a bug? at line 4 character 9

<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Tested on Google hosted Closure service.

<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
Closure seems to be protective about Math in particular, and doesn't like people messing around with her? So, when I try the following code:-
var n = {};
n.blah = function(test) { test.a = 5; };
var test = new Object();
n.blah(test);

It works. When I replace n by Math, then again, Closure kicks out blah. I need that poor fellow. Please talk some sense into it.
