To reproduce:
1. Create/find a html document of a frameset.
2. Parse the html.
3. Create a Cleaner instance and call the clean method with the document from step 2.
4. NullPointerException

Cause:
In Cleaner.clean(Document) (https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jsoup/safety/Cleaner.java#L43) the copySafeNodes is called with the document.body(). However, this is null when handling a frameset document.

Expected:
An empty document or perhaps null returned. But not a nullpointerException.
