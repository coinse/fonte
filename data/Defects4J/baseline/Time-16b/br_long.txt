In Joda Time 2.0, the default year was set to 2000 so that Feb 29 could be parsed correctly. However, parseInto now overwrites the given instant's year with 2000 (or whatever iDefaultYear is set to). The correct behavior would seem to be to use the given instant's year instead of iDefaultYear.
This does mean that Feb 29 might not be parseable if the instant's year is not a leap year, but in this case the caller asked for that in a sense.
