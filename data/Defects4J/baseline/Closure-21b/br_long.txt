<b>Purpose of code changes:</b>
When it comes to an expression involving the comma operator, only the
first element of such a sequence is checked for being free of side
effects. If the element is free of side effects, it is classified as
problematic and a warning is issued.

As other non-rightmost elements are not checked for being free of side
effects and therefore cannot be classified as problematic, this leads
to unexpected behavior:

1. foo((1, 2, 42)) is transformed into foo((1, 3)) and a warning is
issued only with regard to the first element.
2. foo((bar(), 2, 42)) is transformed into foo((bar(), 3)) and no
warning is issued.
3. foo(((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 42))) is transformed into foo((1, 4, 42)) and
warnings are issued with regard to the first elements of inner
sequences only.
