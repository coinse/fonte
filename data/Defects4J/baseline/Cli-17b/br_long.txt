PosixParser doesn't stop the bursting process of a token if stopAtNonOption is enabled and a non option character is encountered.

For example if the options a and b are defined, with stopAtNonOption=true the following command line:

{code}-azb{code}

is turned into:

{code}-a zb -b{code}

the right output should be:

{code}-a zb{code}
